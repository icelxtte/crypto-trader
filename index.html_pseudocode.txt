Create a form to select cryptocurrency and time period:

Use <select> elements to choose a cryptocurrency and a time period.

Add submit button:

Use a <button> to allow users to submit the form.
Display the generated cryptocurrency graph:

If a plot image (plot_img) is returned from Flask, embed it in an <img> element using base64 encoding:

<img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ plot_img }}" alt="Cryptocurrency Graph">
Add AJAX script to handle form submission:

Prevent page reload on form submit.
Capture selected cryptocurrency and time period values.
Use $.post() to send the data to the Flask backend (/), and replace the page's content with the response.
Update the page dynamically with the new graph and price.
